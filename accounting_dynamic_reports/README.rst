This module provides a dynamic balance sheet and profit and loss report in both landscape mode as well as portrait mode.
In the landscape mode, we can configure which section to appear in the left and which side to appear on the right.
We can drill down from the main report to the journal entries associated with each accounts. We can open the form view
of each journal entries and view the complete details.

After the installation, a new menu, 'Dynamic Reports' will be appeared. This menu will open a new wizard where we can select the report,
date duration, type of report, etc.

For the landscape mode report, we need to configure the sequence of the reports. From the Accounting -> Configuration ->
Financial Reports ->Account Reports. Report with sequence '0' will be shown in the left side and report with sequence '1'
